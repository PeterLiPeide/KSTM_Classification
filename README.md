# KSTM_Classification

## An update is under development, and few mistakes will be corrected. Please wait for the latest update!


This is a Project for High dimensional Tensor classification. We have adopted a svm type of classifier for tensor data.

We have published the first version (Version 1.0) of our python code. The packge is still under developing. However, everyone is welcome to try our model in your classification applications. One can find a demo from our simulation study code.


The functions require a package for tensor operations. The package is called Tensorly, which is available at http://tensorly.org/stable/index.html.


Update

A STM module demo is available for test. New update includes an option for compressing tensors in order to speed up the computation.
